					<p>For 35 years I have been caring for people in the hospital;  I have been saved by the beauty of those people. Despite their pain, confusion and grief, their beauty is revealed when they have the emotional support they need. With empathetic connection, their despair lightens. When their pain is acknowledged and their experiences are validated, an ease returns and vitality becomes accessible again.   If you have found yourself suppressing your emotions, feeling numb or detached; if you're emotionally exhausted and burnt out.  Let’s talk.</p>


					<p>The beauty and complexities of humans and human relationships has fueled my curiosities for as long as I can remember.  Gestalt therapy has been an essential support to my life for the past two decades.  Raised by religious fundamentalist, it was a process for me to find a way to be at peace with myself as a queer solo parent raising a neuro-spicy son. Gestalt equipped me with a curiosity for myself and the other.  I basked in the support of relational therapists who nudged me to see my patterns of relating to myself and other people.  These newly revealed awarenesses enlivened me and gave me permission to seek out more gusto and zest for my life.</p>

					<p>If you have found yourself suppressing your emotions, feeling numb or detached; if you're emotionally exhausted and burnt out.  Let’s talk.</p>

<p>Do you feel alone, silenced and you tell yourself you have to ”tough it out”?  Here is how I like to help.  Come, let’s sit together and talk.  Tell me what has been bothering you.  Let's spend time together and find a way to make sense of your experiences, your pains and let’s talk.                                                                   .                 
</p>



<p>I will listen and offer you my gentle caring attunement and then I will offer an immediate response to what is arising between us.  My aim is that with our combined curiosity and wonder, we will find new awareness that will reveal greater options and creativity for you to access as you face the challenges of your life.  </p>
  

<p>My approach is gentle but direct and I am here to support you in the moment as we explore what is unfolding in your field of awareness as we touch on old patterns or challenging current life situations. I may suggest some ‘experiments’ for you in order to play with different ways of being or different modes of expression (e.g. a movement, creative modes of expression, etc.).</p>
